# React Navigation Bar with React Router

This is a simple React application that demonstrates how to create a navigation bar using React Router for navigation between different pages.

## Description

This project showcases the implementation of a navigation bar using React Router, a popular routing library for React applications. The navigation bar includes links to different pages, such as Sign In, Mission, and About pages. Clicking on these links updates the URL and renders the corresponding page content without causing a full page refresh, thanks to React Router's client-side routing capabilities.

## Features

- Navigation bar with links to Sign In, Mission, and About pages
- Client-side routing using React Router
- Dynamic loading of page content without full page refresh

Usage
Once the application is running locally, you can use the navigation bar to navigate between different pages. Clicking on the links for Sign In, Mission, and About will update the URL and display the corresponding page content dynamically.
